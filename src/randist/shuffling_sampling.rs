The following functions allow the shuffling and sampling of a set of objects.
The algorithms rely on a random number generator as a source of randomness and a poor quality generator can lead to correlations in the output.
In particular it is important to avoid generators with a short period. For more information see Knuth, v2, 3rd ed, Section 3.4.2, “Random Sampling and Shuffling”.
