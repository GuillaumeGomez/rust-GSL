///##Permutations in cyclic form
/// 
/// A permutation can be represented in both linear and cyclic notations. The functions described in this section convert between the two forms.
/// The linear notation is an index mapping, and has already been described above. The cyclic notation expresses a permutation as a series of
/// circular rearrangements of groups of elements, or cycles.
/// 
/// For example, under the cycle (1 2 3), 1 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 3 and 3 is replaced by 1 in a circular fashion. Cycles of different
/// sets of elements can be combined independently, for example (1 2 3) (4 5) combines the cycle (1 2 3) with the cycle (4 5), which is an exchange
/// of elements 4 and 5. A cycle of length one represents an element which is unchanged by the permutation and is referred to as a singleton.
/// 
/// It can be shown that every permutation can be decomposed into combinations of cycles. The decomposition is not unique, but can always be
/// rearranged into a standard canonical form by a reordering of elements. The library uses the canonical form defined in Knuth’s Art of Computer
/// Programming (Vol 1, 3rd Ed, 1997) Section 1.3.3, p.178.
/// 
/// The procedure for obtaining the canonical form given by Knuth is,
/// 
/// Write all singleton cycles explicitly
/// Within each cycle, put the smallest number first
/// Order the cycles in decreasing order of the first number in the cycle.
/// For example, the linear representation (2 4 3 0 1) is represented as (1 4) (0 2 3) in canonical form. The permutation corresponds to an exchange
/// of elements 1 and 4, and rotation of elements 0, 2 and 3.
/// 
/// The important property of the canonical form is that it can be reconstructed from the contents of each cycle without the brackets. In addition,
/// by removing the brackets it can be considered as a linear representation of a different permutation. In the example given above the permutation
/// (2 4 3 0 1) would become (1 4 0 2 3). This mapping has many applications in the theory of permutations.
