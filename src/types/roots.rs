# One dimensional Root-Finding

This chapter describes routines for finding roots of arbitrary one-dimensional functions.
The library provides low level components for a variety of iterative solvers and convergence
tests. These can be combined by the user to achieve the desired solution, with full access to
the intermediate steps of the iteration. Each class of methods uses the same framework, so
that you can switch between solvers at runtime without needing to recompile your program.
Each instance of a solver keeps track of its own state, allowing the solvers to be used in
multi-threaded programs.

## Overview

One-dimensional root finding algorithms can be divided into two classes, root bracketing and
root polishing. Algorithms which proceed by bracketing a root are guaranteed to converge.
Bracketing algorithms begin with a bounded region known to contain a root. The size of
this bounded region is reduced, iteratively, until it encloses the root to a desired tolerance.
This provides a rigorous error estimate for the location of the root.

The technique of root polishing attempts to improve an initial guess to the root. These
algorithms converge only if started “close enough” to a root, and sacrifice a rigorous error
bound for speed. By approximating the behavior of a function in the vicinity of a root they
attempt to find a higher order improvement of an initial guess. When the behavior of the
function is compatible with the algorithm and a good initial guess is available a polishing
algorithm can provide rapid convergence.

In GSL both types of algorithm are available in similar frameworks. The user provides
a high-level driver for the algorithms, and the library provides the individual functions
necessary for each of the steps. There are three main phases of the iteration. The steps are,
• initialize solver state, s, for algorithm T
• update s using the iteration T
• test s for convergence, and repeat iteration if necessary

The state for bracketing solvers is held in a gsl_root_fsolver struct. The updating
procedure uses only function evaluations (not derivatives). The state for root polishing
solvers is held in a gsl_root_fdfsolver struct. The updates require both the function and
its derivative (hence the name fdf) to be supplied by the user.

interval. If a valid initial interval is used then these algorithm cannot fail, provided the
function is well-behaved.
Note that a bracketing algorithm cannot find roots of even degree, since these do not
cross the x-axis."
